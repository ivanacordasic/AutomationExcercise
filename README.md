# AutomationExcercise

## In this project I am automating functions of the Automation Excercise Web site.

- This project was built for the purpose of shortening the time acquired for running through specific steps on this Web site:
    - Signing up
    - Logging in
    - Deleting the account
    - etc.
- But mostly, it was created for my practice! :) 

## Tests
In the Feature folder there is a RegisterUser.feature file where you can find an Example table. Feel free to insert any data and run your tests with the provided code.
